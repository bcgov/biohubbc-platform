Dockerized GeoServer comes from https://github.com/NickPhura/docker-geoserver which is a modified fork of https://github.com/kartoza/docker-geoserver

- Modifications were needed to make the original kartoza docker setup compatible with OpenShift, specifically due to how OpenShift controls users/permissions within its pods (containers).

The GeoServer project, and its documentation, can be found here: https://geoserver.org/
